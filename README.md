### Flood Risk Overview and Catchment Insights Dashboard
This project focuses on flood risk assessment and visualization by analyzing rainfall, land use, soil type, and elevation data. Using Power BI and Python (Jupyter Notebook), the project classifies regions into High, Medium, and Low risk categories, helping identify flood-prone areas and catchments that require urgent attention.

The dashboard enables stakeholders to:

Monitor the distribution of risk levels across catchments, cities, and wards.

Identify catchments with the highest number of high-risk segments.

Explore relationships between rainfall intensity, soil groups, and elevation.

Support data-driven disaster preparedness, urban planning, and resource allocation.
